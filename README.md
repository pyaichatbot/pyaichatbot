# Hi there, I'm Praveen Yellamaraju 👋

**AI Educator | AI Advisor | Full-Stack Developer | Building the Future of AI Education**

I'm on a mission to democratize AI education by creating comprehensive, hands-on learning experiences that bridge theory and practice. From interactive playgrounds to production-ready code, I build tools and content that make complex AI concepts accessible to everyone.

---

## 🚀 What I'm Building

### 🎓 [AI Learning Playground](https://github.com/pyaichatbot/ai-learning-playground)
A comprehensive React-based platform for hands-on AI learning with three core modules:
- **RAG Studio**: Interactive document chunking and retrieval visualization
- **Agent Lab**: Reasoning pattern demonstrations (ReAct, Chain-of-Thought, Tree-of-Thoughts)
- **Multi-Agent Arena**: Agent orchestration and collaboration patterns

**Tech Stack**: TypeScript, React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Zustand, Framer Motion

### 📝 [Educational Blog @ yellamaraju.com/blog](https://yellamaraju.com/blog)
In-depth technical articles on:
- RAG systems and retrieval strategies
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Agentic AI and autonomous systems
- Production-ready AI implementations
- Data quality in AI systems

**5-20 minute reads** targeting audiences from non-technical to experienced developers

## 🎯 My Approach

### Educational Philosophy
- **Multi-Audience Content**: Every piece targets non-technical, beginner, and experienced developers simultaneously
- **Interactive Learning**: Hands-on playgrounds and visualizations over passive reading
- **Production-Ready**: Enterprise-grade code following SOLID principles, not just tutorials
- **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, build depth gradually

### Development Principles
- **SOLID Design**: Clean architecture in every project
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript for frontend, Pydantic for backend
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit, integration, and E2E coverage
- **Documentation First**: README-driven development
